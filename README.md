# perl
It has been over 10-15 years since I last used Perl in connection with web development. It used to be handy when shared hosting didn't allow any dynamic frameworks. Here are a few Perl scripts I write that did a little more than just handle the standard form submission.

* [postcards](/postcards) - this script allowed users to send and retrieve "postcards" with friends. postcards.pl allowed user to select and send a postcard. postcardget.pl allowed a user to retrieve a postcard they were sent.

* [search](/search) - this script did an online search of judges by looping through a directory of html files.

* [quiz](/quiz) - Perl CGI Script allowed an administrator to easily change the weekly quiz questions.
